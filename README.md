# Vex Over Under Robot Code
Code for the 2023 - 2024 Vex Season

# About
This is the codebase for 56727C Vex Over Under. Note that this isn't the best code I've ever written, as it was often done in a rush due to time constraints after building. This contains the full iterations of our driver code, 15-second autons, as well as our auton skills.

While this codebase changed to meet the needs of the existing build, here is an example of what the bot could do for auton.

15-second rush auton
